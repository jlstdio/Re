# Re
Project to make your old Android smart phone into a SmartSpeaker

# Why am I doing this?
When we change our phone old phone is hard to throw away because smartphone is combination of so many different material.

So unless you can disassemble your entire phone we not allowed to just throw away to the garbage.

But if you use your phone in meaningful way, like making your phone into a smart speaker.

It would be good for you and good for our planet too!
